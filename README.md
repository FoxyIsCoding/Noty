## Getting Started

To set up and run Noty locally or deploy it, follow these simple steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FoxyIsCoding/Noty

```

### 2. Open the Project:

Navigate to the cloned directory:

```bash
cd Noty

```

Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to preview the app locally. For example:

-   On Windows: Double-click `index.html` or drag it into a browser.
-   On macOS/Linux: Use `open index.html` (macOS) or `xdg-open index.html` (Linux).

### 3. Set Up Firebase:

1.  Create a Firebase project at [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com).
2.  Enable Authentication and Firestore Database in the Firebase Console.
3.  Copy your Firebase configuration (API key, auth domain, project ID, etc.).
4.  Update the `auth.js` file in the project with your Firebase configuration details. It should look something like this:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-auth-domain",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-storage-bucket",
  messagingSenderId: "your-messaging-sender-id",
  appId: "your-app-id"
};

```

### 4. Test Locally:

Reload the `index.html` file in your browser to ensure Firebase connects properly. You should now be able to use Noty‚Äôs features locally.

### 5. Deploy (Optional):

-   Host the files on a web server (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Firebase Hosting).
